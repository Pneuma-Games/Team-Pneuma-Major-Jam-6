The root of Assets/ folder is for all the 3rd party assets - art, tools, whatever.
The "_Project" folder is for things created by us - there are categorized subfolders there to put things in. If a category you need doesn't exist - create it.
The "_Project/_Life" folder contains our assembly. All of our code goes there. Remember to keep your namespaces tidy.
